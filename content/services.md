## Problem Solving Session
What will break when you scale up your team quickly?  
Worried your tech burn is too high and you're not sure about the outcomes delivered?  
Concerned about the quality of your product but no clear way of defining what's good?  
Conversations with your CTO are stuck in technical detail without clarity of impact on the business?

This format is best if you already know your key problem, but are looking for someone with experience to bring a new perspective on solutions.

In **90 minutes** we'll discuss **actions** you can take for your **1 key problem**

-------
## Strategy Alignment Workshop
You probably have a plan for the business. But are you sure your technology is getting you there?  
Are you getting value for money from your product delivery function?  
How would you measure that?  
And does the wider team know what the plan is?  

This is a **half or full day workshop** where we'll discuss your technology strategy and how it aligns with your business goals.

Best enjoyed with **CEO & CTO together**.  
The goal here is to **create clarity**, not technolgoy.

-------
## CTO Coaching
Every CTO has a journey to become a business leader, and every CTO has a different path.  
But a little help along the way can make a big difference.  

We will identify the key gaps to address, based on my [4 stages framework](/posts/4-stages-of-a-cto/) and your CTO's profile, and create a 6 month coaching schedule for your CTO.

During these **6 months** we'll have regular scheduled sessions designed to bridge the gap between technology leadership and business expectations. So CTO learn to communicate better, clearer and in a language fit for the boardroom. 
A clear focus on **improving your CTO's business thinking** and **developing their leadership skills**.

-------
## Interim & Transformation work
Sometimes you need an outsider to come in and help you over that hurdle.  
Let me be your experienced catalyst for driving big changes. 

I've led **technology restructures**, **process implementations**, **strategy re-alignment** all driven by a strong foundation in the business strategy.

## Advisory retainer
I've been in many rooms where difficult decisions need to be made. Sometimes you want someone outside the circle to bounce ideas around and ask for feedback before pulling the trigger. 

The offer is simple:  
I've been there and done that.  
Tap into my experience anytime you have a question.
