CTO Stages

The Lean Startup CTO
Team size: Small team (alone or just a few developers)
Focus: Hands-on coding and building the MVP
Responsibilities: Rolling up sleeves alongside the team, making quick technical tradeoffs based on execution speed
Value: Turning whiteboard visions into reality through direct technical contribution, focus usually on speed of change over anything else
The Managerial CTO
Team size: 15&#43; engineering team members with specialized roles
Focus: Establishing processes and coordination rather than direct coding
Responsibilities: Owning architecture, security, and compliance while empowering teams to execute autonomously
Value: Creating systems for how technology components work together and decisions are made. Basis of measuring in place, but close enough to know the details
The Scaled CTO
Team size: 50-100 people across multiple engineering teams
Focus: Cross-team alignment and managing managers (not individual contributors)
Responsibilities: Serving as the glue between departments, bridging priorities and making tradeoffs
Value: Ensuring all teams are rowing in the same direction through unified progress and relying on measures/objective datapoint rather than gut feel
The Strategic CTO
Team size: 100&#43;
Focus: Financial performance, competitive positioning, and business partnerships
Responsibilities: Representing technology in the boardroom, delegating hands-on leadership to VPs
Value: Guiding overall company direction through technology strategy while maintaining technical principles

<p>How do CEOs support their CTO</p>
<ol>
<li>The Lean Startup CTO
CEO&rsquo;s Role: Empowerment and Focus
Judge progress based on working software shipped, not process formality
Focus conversations on short-term technical tradeoffs and their future implications
Discuss the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind decisions rather than the specifics of implementation
Ask key questions like:
How will this scale with many new users?
Can we quickly pivot to new customer insights?
How quickly can you gather data to steer decisions?
Accept less predictability in timelines in exchange for flexibility and speed</li>
<li>The Managerial CTO (Post-Seed Stage)
CEO&rsquo;s Role: Planning and Accountability
Keep everyone focused on a clearly outlined plan and ensure the company follows it
Be prepared to discuss priorities and resource needs
Appreciate that technical work needs to happen, but challenge your CTO to explain &ldquo;why&rdquo; or &ldquo;why now&rdquo;
Ensure your CTO is empowering their team rather than being a bottleneck
Help them transition from doing everything themselves to achieving results through leadership</li>
<li>The Scaled CTO (Scale Stage)
CEO&rsquo;s Role: Strategic Perspective
Ask questions that help your CTO step back from details and see the bigger picture
Work closely to ensure they understand how their team&rsquo;s work fits into overall company strategy
Focus discussions on how teams interact and collaborate
Help align teams on outcomes that drive desired behaviors
Recognize that success metrics evolve - emphasize team alignment around clear vision over just roadmaps and delivery</li>
<li>The Strategic CTO
CEO&rsquo;s Role: Executive Partnership
Partner with the CTO as a fellow executive focused on company direction
Ensure the CTO has the right information structure so key insights bubble up timely
Support their role in representing technology in the boardroom
Help maintain the balance between strategic focus and staying connected to engineering principles</li>
</ol>
