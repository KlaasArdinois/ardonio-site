<p>You probably have a plan for the business. But are you sure your technology is getting you there?<br>
Are you getting value for money from your product delivery function?<br>
How would you measure that?<br>
And does the wider team know what the plan is?</p>
<p>This is a <strong>half or full day workshop</strong> where we&rsquo;ll discuss your technology strategy and how it aligns with your business goals.</p>
<p>Best enjoyed with <strong>CEO &amp; CTO together</strong>.<br>

<p>Every CTO has a journey to become a business leader, and every CTO has a different path.<br>
But a little help along the way can make a big difference.</p>
<p>We will identify the key gaps to address, based on my <a href="/posts/4-stages-of-a-cto/" >4 stages framework</a> and your CTO&rsquo;s profile, and create a 6 month coaching schedule for your CTO.</p>
<p>During these <strong>6 months</strong> we&rsquo;ll have regular scheduled sessions designed to bridge the gap between technology leadership and business expectations. So CTO learn to communicate better, clearer and in a language fit for the boardroom.
A clear focus on <strong>improving your CTO&rsquo;s business thinking</strong> and <strong>developing their leadership skills</strong>.</p>
