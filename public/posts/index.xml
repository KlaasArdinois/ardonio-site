      <description>&lt;p&gt;Picture this: a man lounges by his swimming pool as the last of the summer sun sets. In the distance is a town getting ready for evening ruckus. But here, poolside, the only noise is the low hum of the pool&amp;rsquo;s waterfilter pump accentuated by the occasional rustling of the man turning a page in his book. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;That is me on holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which leads to the next question: what am I reading?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The CTO you want, or the CTO you need?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s a question I have asked many CEO over the years. Sometimes I was referring to myself, sometimes a co-founder, sometimes their existing CTO, or a candidate hire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like most executive roles, the CTO role changes with the business. But for clarity, when I think of a CTO, I think of the person who is accountable for everything that goes on in the technology organization. The part of your business that decides what you&amp;rsquo;re going to build, how you&amp;rsquo;re going to build it, and how you&amp;rsquo;ll deal with it when it&amp;rsquo;s live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
