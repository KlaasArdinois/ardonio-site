"The CTO you want, or the CTO you need?".  
It's a question I have asked many CEO over the years. Sometimes I was referring to myself, sometimes a co-founder, sometimes their existing CTO, or a candidate hire.

Like most executive roles, the CTO role changes with the business. But for clarity, when I think of a CTO, I think of the person who is accountable for everything that goes on in the technology organization. The part of your business that decides what you're going to build, how you're going to build it, and how you'll deal with it when it's live.

So let's dive in to what that progression looks like, and how as a CEO you can get the most out of your CTO.

# The Lean Startup CTO
**Team size**: Small team (alone or just a few developers)  
**Focus**: Hands-on coding and building the MVP  
**Responsibilities**: Rolling up sleeves alongside the team, making quick technical tradeoffs based on execution speed  
**Value**: Turning whiteboard visions into reality through direct technical contribution, focus usually on speed of change over anything else

This is perhaps the most stereotypical CTO stage. It's the hands-on stage where the CTO is deep in the technical weeds. If they're not the best programmer in the team, they're certainly involved in every major decision. _(sidenote: if your CTO isn't involved in every major decision, your real CTO at this stage is the person who is)_  

More often than not this is exactly what you need at the early stages of a project or startup. Your only real strategic advantage is speed. So you need the shortest possible feedback loop, and optimize for speed of moving forward. The sooner something workable is in the hands of your audience, the sooner you get feedback. The sooner you get feedback, the sooner you can throw away what didn't work.  
It's ok to build things that won't necessarily scale well, optionality is more important. The goal of a CTO here is to build with an eye on changing things, rather than with an eye on being the 1 true way. That is perhaps the biggest challenge at this stage for most CTO.

## A CEO's perspective
Your role as CEO  here is to **empower**, **drive focus** and **maintain optionality**. The latter part is often where it gets tricky. A CTO will push for as complete a requirements as possible, as CEO you want the option to evolve in many directions.  
The middle ground is frequent discussion on how the company, and therefore product, might evolve. But making clear when it is time to actively build and when you're talking about what _could_ happen.  
The measure of good progress here is consistently putting changes in the hands of customers, and enabling quick iterations.  
Focus your conversations on optionality,and the tradeoffs made during building. 

Conversation starters:
How will this scale when we onboard 10x new users?
How hard would it be to undo our latest upgrade and take a different direction?
How quickly can you gather and parse insight from our usage data?

CTO Stages
1. The Lean Startup CTO
Team size: Small team (alone or just a few developers)
Focus: Hands-on coding and building the MVP
Responsibilities: Rolling up sleeves alongside the team, making quick technical tradeoffs based on execution speed
Value: Turning whiteboard visions into reality through direct technical contribution, focus usually on speed of change over anything else
2. The Managerial CTO
Team size: 15+ engineering team members with specialized roles
Focus: Establishing processes and coordination rather than direct coding
Responsibilities: Owning architecture, security, and compliance while empowering teams to execute autonomously
Value: Creating systems for how technology components work together and decisions are made. Basis of measuring in place, but close enough to know the details
3. The Scaled CTO
Team size: 50-100 people across multiple engineering teams
Focus: Cross-team alignment and managing managers (not individual contributors)
Responsibilities: Serving as the glue between departments, bridging priorities and making tradeoffs
Value: Ensuring all teams are rowing in the same direction through unified progress and relying on measures/objective datapoint rather than gut feel
4. The Strategic CTO
Team size: 100+
Focus: Financial performance, competitive positioning, and business partnerships
Responsibilities: Representing technology in the boardroom, delegating hands-on leadership to VPs
Value: Guiding overall company direction through technology strategy while maintaining technical principles

How do CEOs support their CTO
1. The Lean Startup CTO
CEO's Role: Empowerment and Focus
Judge progress based on working software shipped, not process formality
Focus conversations on short-term technical tradeoffs and their future implications
Discuss the "why" behind decisions rather than the specifics of implementation
Ask key questions like:
How will this scale with many new users?
Can we quickly pivot to new customer insights?
How quickly can you gather data to steer decisions?
Accept less predictability in timelines in exchange for flexibility and speed
2. The Managerial CTO (Post-Seed Stage)
CEO's Role: Planning and Accountability
Keep everyone focused on a clearly outlined plan and ensure the company follows it
Be prepared to discuss priorities and resource needs
Appreciate that technical work needs to happen, but challenge your CTO to explain "why" or "why now"
Ensure your CTO is empowering their team rather than being a bottleneck
Help them transition from doing everything themselves to achieving results through leadership
3. The Scaled CTO (Scale Stage)
CEO's Role: Strategic Perspective
Ask questions that help your CTO step back from details and see the bigger picture
Work closely to ensure they understand how their team's work fits into overall company strategy
Focus discussions on how teams interact and collaborate
Help align teams on outcomes that drive desired behaviors
Recognize that success metrics evolve - emphasize team alignment around clear vision over just roadmaps and delivery
4. The Strategic CTO
CEO's Role: Executive Partnership
Partner with the CTO as a fellow executive focused on company direction
Ensure the CTO has the right information structure so key insights bubble up timely
Support their role in representing technology in the boardroom
Help maintain the balance between strategic focus and staying connected to engineering principles
